Description:
    This is a modification of HDoutliers package. The HDoutliers algorithm is a powerful 
    unsupervised algorithm for detecting anomalies in high-dimensional data, with a 
    strong theoretical foundation. However, it suffers from some limitations that 
    significantly hinder its performance level, under certain circumstances. In 
    this package, we propose an algorithm that addresses these limitations. We 
    define an anomaly as an observation that deviates markedly from the majority
    with a large distance gap. An approach based on extreme value theory is used 
    for the anomalous threshold calculation.
